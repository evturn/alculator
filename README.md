Users select from a vast investory of alcoholic beverages. In addition, users have access to a massive beer database in which they can search to find a particular beer. Based on the user's selection(s) Alculator retrieves the alcohol percentages for any selected beverages.

That data is then added to a formula where along with the user's information is then calculated to return the individual's blood alcohol level

In addition to the final calculation, the output gives a description of the level of intoxication along with a color scheme representing one of the five stages, starting with low traces at Stage One and topping out at Stage Five with, unfortunately, impending death. It's science.
